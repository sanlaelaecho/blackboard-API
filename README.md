# BLACKBOARD API
Welcome to Blackboard API! This API intends to allow admins, teachers and students to look up subjects, create and edit cohorts for the subjects, create and edit assignments for the cohorts. Admins have access to backend functions such as delete users or subjects or editing their information. Teachers can create their own cohorts and assignments while also being able to grade students' submissions. Students can create and edit submissions for these assignments while also view their own grades. Everyone can view all subjects and cohorts. Generally, this gradebook API functions as a simple version of a blackboard and in the future, hopes to be further developed into a blackboard. For more detailed functions on the API, see the Github project planner [here](https://github.com/users/sanlaelaecho/projects/1/views/1).
